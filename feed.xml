Yes. That will be you. You reading this. Your name will be Elias.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest problem with writing these blog posts is never knowing &lt;i&gt; who &lt;/i&gt; I’m writing for. So here we are. I am designating you, the reader as Elias. This will give me a person, a one man audience, to write to, to give me a direction for all these posts. Why Elias? I don’t know. It was just the first name to show up in my head. Elias is a name of an NPC in my D&amp;amp;D setting so it’llb e a little weird because at times it’ll feel like I’m writing to a fictional fantasy character but who knows maybe that’ll be easier… or maybe it won’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay thanks Elias!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Elias. Yes. That will be you. You reading this. Your name will be Elias.

This is what it’s all been leading towards. This right here. My blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been wanting to start journaling for a year or two now and I’ve wanted to start a website for much longer. So I guess the best thing was to check both off my To Do List and start a blog. I’ve gotten a free domain name thanks to my school e-mail, and I think it’s only free for a year it’s okay. A year’s longer than nothing. It’ll at least let me try out this whole blogging ordeal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why blog? At first it was just a hobby that I’ve wanted to pick up (journaling that is). But these days it serves a higher purpose. Its so curb my anxiety. I’ve been told that journaling and writing about my anxiety will help me manage it and managing it is super high up on my To Do List these days. So that’s kind of been the main motivation of getting this blog set up, as a means of journaling my anxiety whilst satisfying my desire to start a website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest problem and will always be the biggest problem however is finding the time to write a blog post that completely captures everything that I am thinking at that moment in time. School has been so busy lately and as I lie in bed writing this out I’m dreading my midterm tomorrow that I didn’t study for all weekend because I was at a conference. It doesn’t seem like it will be a hard midterm (it’s Natural Products Biosynthesis… easy right?) but at the same time the lack of studying has been fueling my recent anxiety. It’s been such a long two weeks that I think one this midterm ends tomorrow I’ll feel like a free man as I get to not worry about the exam for a good amount of weeks. Maybe I’ll be able to actually get some work one in the lab or spend some time cleaning it up sincec it has not been tended to for a couple of months now (that’s a a blog post in and of itself).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The anxiety right now is managed. I’m not feeling much in the chest but I feel like it’s not far around the corner and sooner rather than later things are gonna hit the fun, but so far everything seems okay which is a really good sign. Tomorrow marks the beginning of some catch up and I’m really excited, I’ve neglected my To Do List for the last week or so and its starting to get unruly but hey such is life right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have made a grave mistake writing in my bed as I seem to be falling asleep while writing which means ending. Which is what this is.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Well here it is. This is what it’s all been leading towards. This right here. My blog.
