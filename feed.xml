I’ve been preparing for the new year for the last little while now. This website/blog thing has been one of the main results to come of it. I thought the new year would be a good place to start journaling, recording my recent happenings and giving me a way of looking back and reflecting the things that I want to reflect on later down the road. Not to mention it’s also been a dream of mine to start a website (and by extension a blog) and I’ve tried numerous times in the past, all of which didn’t end up well, mostly because of the knowledge which resulted in doing things very tediously and in the end made it a lot of work to upkeep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess now that it’s the new year should start it off by listing off a bunch of goals and things that I want to accomplish. Okay let’s get to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- readmore --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt; JohnRivada.Me &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve mentioned it before but now is the time to go into detail about it. My goal with the website is to journal my happenings because I read somewhere some time ago that journaling is good for you and what better way to kill two birds with one stone than by knocking off the ‘make a website’ entry as well and turning the project into a blog. I also plan to add ‘About Me’ and ‘Academic’ sections as well, and make this my &lt;i&gt;sort of&lt;/i&gt; main online presence. Additionally all this journaling and websiting will most definitely help me in my writing which is something that I want to improve upon. One aspect of my site that is already live is the WAI_? section which is something I look forward to filling out as the year goes on. Long story short (because I will probably touch upon it below) is that it will keep track of the entertainment (podcast, music, anime, games, etc.) that I consume and the plan is to write about them on a monthly basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt; Todoist &amp;amp; GTD &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GTD, or Getting Things Done is an organization framework that I read about &lt;a href=&quot;https://hamberg.no/gtd/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and its something that I’ve been slowly trying to work towards for the better part of the last two years. I’ve been using &lt;a href=&quot;https://todoist.com/overview&quot;&gt;Todoist&lt;/a&gt; as my main way of keeping track of my To Do Lists and have used it for a good amount before stumbling upon the GTD method and so now I’ve been massaging and reformatting my list and projects to resemble something similar to the GTD method and I’ve lately found a system that works well for me. The goal for the year is to maintain this productivity setup and maybe even refine and improve upon it as time goes around. It has proven pretty useful the last couple months, but it can definitely be better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt; General Lifestyle Goals &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one that almost everyone has at every new year. Getting active (and then staying active), less junk food, etc. etc. The big ones for me include getting active, less junk food, a better sleep schedule, and getting my finances in order. I’ve been meaning to get active, either by going for morning runs or by going to the gym with my girlfriend on campus. I’m not trying to lose weight or anything, mostly just stay in shape and stay healthy. Less junk food… I’d like to thank university for that one. Thanks to the time and stress burdens it has given me I’ve gotten into the habit of wanting to just simply order food (mostly McDonalds or Thai Express) instead of eating something I make at home. The amount of soft drinks I consume has also increased and it is admittedly at a level that I enjoy at the moment but don’t when looking back. The plan is to monitor how much I drink and even times I crave a drink and try and reduce it to a better number. Similiar to the junk foods. I’m going to try to limit it to around once a week (or even once every two weeks if I can).  The financial affairs is something of a personally set goal for myself. I’m by no means in any financial trouble (though I’m not super financially set either. If I were on the spectrum of poor to rich out of my mind I’d be hovering near the middle but leaning more towards the poorer side). At the time of writing I’ve got ~$700 in my chequing account, ~$1000 in my savings account, ~$12,000 in my TFSA and $69 (nice) on my credit card bill. I’ve got a lot of holiday bills that I’ve got to sort out so a good chunk of it might going to different accounts but the idea is there. Based off the 50/30/20 (Of my paychecks, the money is allotted 50% to savings, 30% to living, and 20% to whatever I want) budget I started 2 years ago, I’m currently in a deficit where I have overspent by ~$2,700. So on the topic of finances, one goal of mine is to take ~$200 off each paycheck and put it towards this ‘personal debt’ I have acquired. Additionally I want to look back at the spending I did in 2019 and find spots where I could limit spending and thus save money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt; Backlogs &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay so this is where WAI_? comes into play. There’s &lt;b&gt;a lot&lt;/b&gt; of games that I bought and haven’t played or media that I started/want to start and haven’t finished. I’ve got all my PS4, Switch and PC games that I bought and want to play. Additionally (but not as importantly) I also have games on my 3DS, PSP, PSVita and PS3 that I bought and want to finish. It’s a huge backlog and so one goal I have for the year is to finish with more games finished than played. A big task but it’s probably doable. I’ve also got a list of podcasts that I enjoy and want to catch up on. And the same can be said for anime. manga, books, TV shows, and movies. I definitely want to play/read/listen to at least a good chunk of it for the new year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt; Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lumeray, a D&amp;amp;D setting I created has been the child of my players whoms’t I appreciate so so much and myself from playing D&amp;amp;D the last two years. They started from level 1 and are currently at level 9, with the third season coming starting up in May. There have been 3 core players with 2 players that left due to moving out of the city. It is something that I want to develop, flesh out, and be really proud of (not to say that I’m not already proud of it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt; Hobbies &amp;amp; Other Things &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading more is definitely something I want to do. Continue my school is another thing, and maybe pick up a couple hobbies here and there. But those are low on the list and I haven’t put as much thought into them as I did the others.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="site" /><summary type="html">Okay so it’s finally the new year.

Yes. That will be you. You reading this. Your name will be Elias.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest problem with writing these blog posts is never knowing &lt;i&gt; who &lt;/i&gt; I’m writing for. So here we are. I am designating you, the reader as Elias. This will give me a person, a one man audience, to write to, to give me a direction for all these posts. Why Elias? I don’t know. It was just the first name to show up in my head. Elias is a name of an NPC in my D&amp;amp;D setting so it’llb e a little weird because at times it’ll feel like I’m writing to a fictional fantasy character but who knows maybe that’ll be easier… or maybe it won’t.&lt;/p&gt;

This is what it’s all been leading towards. This right here. My blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been wanting to start journaling for a year or two now and I’ve wanted to start a website for much longer. So I guess the best thing was to check both off my To Do List and start a blog. I’ve gotten a free domain name thanks to my school e-mail, and I think it’s only free for a year it’s okay. A year’s longer than nothing. It’ll at least let me try out this whole blogging ordeal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why blog? At first it was just a hobby that I’ve wanted to pick up (journaling that is). But these days it serves a higher purpose. Its so curb my anxiety. I’ve been told that journaling and writing about my anxiety will help me manage it and managing it is super high up on my To Do List these days. So that’s kind of been the main motivation of getting this blog set up, as a means of journaling my anxiety whilst satisfying my desire to start a website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest problem and will always be the biggest problem however is finding the time to write a blog post that completely captures everything that I am thinking at that moment in time. School has been so busy lately and as I lie in bed writing this out I’m dreading my midterm tomorrow that I didn’t study for all weekend because I was at a conference. It doesn’t seem like it will be a hard midterm (it’s Natural Products Biosynthesis… easy right?) but at the same time the lack of studying has been fueling my recent anxiety. It’s been such a long two weeks that I think one this midterm ends tomorrow I’ll feel like a free man as I get to not worry about the exam for a good amount of weeks. Maybe I’ll be able to actually get some work one in the lab or spend some time cleaning it up sincec it has not been tended to for a couple of months now (that’s a a blog post in and of itself).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The anxiety right now is managed. I’m not feeling much in the chest but I feel like it’s not far around the corner and sooner rather than later things are gonna hit the fun, but so far everything seems okay which is a really good sign. Tomorrow marks the beginning of some catch up and I’m really excited, I’ve neglected my To Do List for the last week or so and its starting to get unruly but hey such is life right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have made a grave mistake writing in my bed as I seem to be falling asleep while writing which means ending. Which is what this is.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog" /><summary type="html">Well here it is. This is what it’s all been leading towards. This right here.
