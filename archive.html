			<p> <p>Okay so it’s finally the new year. I’ve been preparing for the new year for the last little while now. This website/blog thing has been one of the main results to come of it. I thought the new year would be a good place to start journaling, recording my recent happenings and giving me a way of looking back and reflecting the things that I want to reflect on later down the road. Not to mention it’s also been a dream of mine to start a website (and by extension a blog) and I’ve tried numerous times in the past, all of which didn’t end up well, mostly because of the knowledge which resulted in doing things very tediously and in the end made it a lot of work to upkeep.</p>

<p>I guess now that it’s the new year should start it off by listing off a bunch of goals and things that I want to accomplish. Okay let’s get to it.</p>

			<p> <p>Elias. Yes. That will be you. You reading this. Your name will be Elias.</p>

<p>The biggest problem with writing these blog posts is never knowing <i> who </i> I’m writing for. So here we are. I am designating you, the reader as Elias. This will give me a person, a one man audience, to write to, to give me a direction for all these posts. Why Elias? I don’t know. It was just the first name to show up in my head. Elias is a name of an NPC in my D&amp;D setting so it’llb e a little weird because at times it’ll feel like I’m writing to a fictional fantasy character but who knows maybe that’ll be easier… or maybe it won’t.</p>

<p>Okay thanks Elias!</p>

			<p> <p>Well here it is. This is what it’s all been leading towards. This right here. My blog.</p>

<p>I’ve been wanting to start journaling for a year or two now and I’ve wanted to start a website for much longer. So I guess the best thing was to check both off my To Do List and start a blog. I’ve gotten a free domain name thanks to my school e-mail, and I think it’s only free for a year it’s okay. A year’s longer than nothing. It’ll at least let me try out this whole blogging ordeal.</p>

<p>So why blog? At first it was just a hobby that I’ve wanted to pick up (journaling that is). But these days it serves a higher purpose. Its so curb my anxiety. I’ve been told that journaling and writing about my anxiety will help me manage it and managing it is super high up on my To Do List these days. So that’s kind of been the main motivation of getting this blog set up, as a means of journaling my anxiety whilst satisfying my desire to start a website.</p>
