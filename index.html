			<p> <p>This month on WAI_? that’s totally not 10+ days late, I listeneded to a bunch of podcasts. Started reading The Mighty Thor, A Flash Miniseries, and watched some shows. But the one big thing that I’m going to talk about this week is CW’s Crisis On Infinite Earths. Crisis (as I will refer to it henceforth) is the name of this year’s annual crossover between the shows that exist in the Arrowverse. Previous crossovers included Flash vs. Arrow, Heroes Join Forces, Invasion!, and Crisis on Earth X. But this year, Crisis On Infinite Earths, step the game up to a whole new level that I didn’t even know existed.</p>
