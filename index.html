			<p> <p>This month on WAI_?, I got to attend Noah Pacheco’s album release party for his latest album Elixir. Noah’s a good friend of mine and a very talented musician. Green Day released a new album! Played a bunch of games, and completed 4, noteable ones being Spider-Man for the PS4 and Plants vs. Zombies on the PC. I got back into Overwatch. I watched the first season of Sex Education (stay tuned for my thoughts on that one). I concluded the Flash Forward mini-series and started reading The Mighty Thor (2016).  But this month’s in-depth WAI_? has to go to CW’s Arrow, a superhero TV show about a rich arrogent jerk millionaire’s son turned caring, time-travelling universe saving father and superhero.</p>
