			<p> <p>This month on WAI_? that’s totally not 10+ days late, I listeneded to a bunch of podcasts. Started reading The Mighty Thor, A Flash Miniseries, and watched some shows. But the one big thing that I’m going to talk about this week is CW’s Crisis On Infinite Earths. Crisis (as I will refer to it henceforth) is the name of this year’s annual crossover between the shows that exist in the Arrowverse. Previous crossovers included Flash vs. Arrow, Heroes Join Forces, Invasion!, and Crisis on Earth X. But this year, Crisis On Infinite Earths, step the game up to a whole new level that I didn’t even know existed.</p>

			<p> <p>Okay so it’s finally the new year. I’ve been preparing for the new year for the last little while now. This website/blog thing has been one of the main results to come of it. I thought the new year would be a good place to start journaling, recording my recent happenings and giving me a way of looking back and reflecting the things that I want to reflect on later down the road. Not to mention it’s also been a dream of mine to start a website (and by extension a blog) and I’ve tried numerous times in the past, all of which didn’t end up well, mostly because of the knowledge which resulted in doing things very tediously and in the end made it a lot of work to upkeep.</p>

<p>I guess now that it’s the new year should start it off by listing off a bunch of goals and things that I want to accomplish. Okay let’s get to it.</p>

			<p> <p>Elias. Yes. That will be you. You reading this. Your name will be Elias.</p>

<p>The biggest problem with writing these blog posts is never knowing <i> who </i> I’m writing for. So here we are. I am designating you, the reader as Elias. This will give me a person, a one man audience, to write to, to give me a direction for all these posts. Why Elias? I don’t know. It was just the first name to show up in my head. Elias is a name of an NPC in my D&amp;D setting so it’llb e a little weird because at times it’ll feel like I’m writing to a fictional fantasy character but who knows maybe that’ll be easier… or maybe it won’t.</p>

<p>Okay thanks Elias!</p>
