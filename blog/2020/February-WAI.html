    <p>This month on WAI_?, I got to attend Noah Pacheco’s album release party for his latest album Elixir. Noah’s a good friend of mine and a very talented musician. Green Day released a new album! Played a bunch of games, and completed 4, noteable ones being Spider-Man for the PS4 and Plants vs. Zombies on the PC. I got back into Overwatch. I watched the first season of Sex Education (stay tuned for my thoughts on that one). I concluded the Flash Forward mini-series and started reading The Mighty Thor (2016).  But this month’s in-depth WAI_? has to go to CW’s Arrow, a superhero TV show about a rich arrogant jerk millionaire’s son turned caring, time-travelling universe saving father and superhero.</p>

<p>[Spoilers for all seasons of Arrow here on out]</p>

<p>I started my journey into the Arrowverse with Flash, when it was recommended to me by an old friend. This was way back in 2014-2015 when it was midway through its second season and Arrow was on its like third season. At the time I was slowly getting to know my way around the Marvel Universe and was slowly creeping into the DC Universe. I knew very little of the Flash, other than the fact that the runs fast and any other exposure from watching Justice League cartoons as a kid. And I got hooked, it was a good and soon I found out that it was actually a spin-off of another superhero TV show that has a much different tone. Eventually, after a couple crossovers I decided to catch up on Arrow and here we are now.</p>

<p>One of the earliest comments I remember about Arrow was between two friends, where one was asking the other what they thought of the show and they had joked about how everyone’s died at least once. I didn’t know it at the time but it was so, so very accurate. The first season got me hooked, and I thought it was good. Oliver Queen is the jerk with a vengeance, motivated by the mistakes of his father and driven by the need to right his wrongs. The story was tight, and revolved around Oliver’s close circle with many plot twists about backstories and secret connections along the way. I was disappointed at the death of Oliver’s best friend at the end of the season, as I wanted to see that dynamic throughout the series but what’s done is done. What I particularly liked was the added complexity of the storytelling where they show the present day events in addition to the story of how Oliver ended up stranded on Lian Yu and ended up rescued 5 years later. It does a good job at relating the present day events and the motivation behind Oliver’s decisions to the mysterious adventures that occured on that island and how they transformed Oliver into a crime fighting vigilante he becomes at the start of the show.</p>

<p>Season 2 is where thinks slowly start to get, for a lack of better terms, <i>comicbooky</i>. The first season was the story of Oliver and his return to civilizaion. The second season starts to add (though in a nice slow manner) more far reaching concepts. An example is the League of Assassins, which with no context is quite eccentric. But it slowly gets added in a reasonable, grounded fashion and it works. Additionally more people are starting to seemingly come back from the dead, which is something that I always enjoy. Oliver’s past on Lian Yu is starting to come back to interfere with present, continuing the really well done double layered storytelling.</p>

<p>The next season took the storyline revolving around the League of Assassins and put it into full swing for the season. It wasn’t my favourite storyline but it definitely not my least liked one either. Things start to get mystical and unexplainable (e.g. mysterious pools that bring people from the dead). I think the reason I didn’t like the storyline is because it felt like a family dispute and less so the adventures of Oliver and him trying to save the city. Although it is a natural progression now that he’s moved on from trying to avenge his father. At this point Oliver’s slowly growing and becoming less so the arrogant playboy at the beginning of the series and is growing into the leader role. Many times did he insist on doing his crusade on his own but now he’s coming around to the idea of accepting the support of his team. Now that flash is established and well underway, this season also marks the inaugural annual crossover event. With Flash and Arrow currently being the only two shows in the Arrowverse, the plot is very grounded and centric to the two shows. Nothing big or extravagant that will happen in later seasons.</p>

<p>Season 4 is one of my least favourite seasons. It just didn’t feel like it stood out like the last three did. The protagonist (Dahrk) had mystical powers, facing against a team of normal people with really good archery skills. Dahrk was an okay villian and his motivations were cookie cutter and nothing new. The flashback storyline wasn’t memorable (as I haven’t been able to remember much from it). One of the upsides to this season is Oliver’s mayoral campaign. At this point he is no longer the man he was in the first season, and is now a leader and public figure. I liked the change and enjoyed watching how the team would dance around Oliver having to be the Green Arrow and the mayor at the same time. However this would probably be in my bottom three of any of the seasons. This year’s crossover event acted as backdoor pilot for <i>another</i> spin-off, this time for Legends of Tomorrow. The plot takes a dive for the magical and mystical with reincarnated characters in their latest reiteration of their cat and mouse hunt. As an Arrowverse watcher, it was fun and connected and felt very comicbooky. But if you were to be a sole Arrow watcher, it would definitely be out of place, shoe horned and it would definitely feel like something coming from left field. It also sets a precedent because if you were to be a sole Arrow viewer this would be a common occurrence each season. The magical and mystical is still being built upon, with the Flash’s accidental time travel and Savage’s magic staff.</p>

<p>Arrow’s fifth season is probably my favourite season. It goes back to the gritty street crime plot that the first couple seasons really excelled in. Oliver’s character progression is now geared towards teaching a new generation and acting as a teacher role, which I enjoyed. The protagonist (Promotheus aka Adrian Chase) is up there with Merlyn and later Diaz for my top 3 favourite villians. It’s revealed that Oliver is a father to a son that is now grown into a young boy and gets roped into team Arrow’s crusade. The addition of seeing Oliver try to become a father initially didn’t sit well with me, but it later grew on me and it was a great direction for his character to proceed. This was also the season where the flashbacks of Oliver’s 5 year Lian Yu story finally catch up. The story feels very personal to Oliver and goes full circle in the best way possible, with Chase bringing team Arrow back to Lian Yu (this however is not the first time Team Arrow has gone back) for the climactic final battle. The season finale was intense, action packed and had the best cliffhanger endings of the series and I enjoyed it very much. The idea of metahumans brought by events occuring in the Flash has become pretty standard now in Arrow but the season did a good job at keeping the mystical and fantastical concepts to a minimum, which was a welcome change. However the biggest fantastical change to the show would be the apprant revival of Laural Lance, who was killed in the prior season. It is later revealed that she is a doppleganger from an alternate earth, now with metahuman powers as opposed to original Laurel using devices to give her powers for fighting villians. Again, as an Arrowverse watcher it was a welcome concept but as a sole Arrow watcher this might be another concept coming from left field and makes the viewer go “Wait what?”. The biggest gripe that I have about the introduction of an alternate dopleganger is the fact that the characters attribute them to their original versions. If an alternate universe character would be killed by an ally, characters would get mad because they ‘killed that character’ and disregard the fact that it’s a different person. The annual crossover begins to scale up in the fantastical, now that there are four shows in the Arrowverse (with Supergirl spinning off of Flash). It was a fun and contained story. Again, as an Arrowverse watcher it works but as a sole Arrow watcher it would definitely throw viewers off due to the stark contrast between ground to earth regularly scheduled programming to the introduction of Aliens, time travelling misfits and alternate earth heroes. Don’t even get my started about how Sarah Diggle got wiped from existence.</p>

<p>Coming in to season 6 I was really excited to see where they would bring the story foreward after a lot of concluding and wrapping up that was done in the last season.  Oliver’s past continues to come back with the form of Slade Wilson aka Deathstroke returning as a secondary storyline. The mid season twist with numerous old villians workign together to take down Team Arrow was a nice twist that continues to wrap up and loose ends from Oliver’s past. The storyline also took a turn when leaked images of Oliver as the Green Arrow begin to surface and force the public to scrutinize Olvier as mayor as well as the vigilante. The notion of Oliver being a father to William is continued and helps with his character growth where he is now a leader, teacher, mayor, and father. The annual crossover is pretty standard, nothing really new or game changing other than the fact that it happened right before Oliver and Felicity’s wedding which was great impeccable timing. The season ends with Oliver’s public admittance to being the Green Arrow followed by his arrest and him sentenced to prison.</p>

<p>Coming to the penultimate season I had some concerns and I really didn’t know where they were going to go at this point. It felt like the show was running out of ideas and I didn’t see where they could drive the plot now that they’ve finished a bunch of previous storylines and make it seem like they’ve “done it all” and finally played the trope where everyone knows the Green Arrows secret identity. But I was pleasantly surprised. With Season 5’s conclusion of the flashbacks and a break with Season 6, Season 7 brings the storytelling forward with flash-forwards, showing a now grown up William 20 years in the future. I liked the addition of the dramatic irony where we know the future fates of these characters. It adds a bit of tragedy knowing how the present day’s characters can affect the future storylines. At the end of the storyline involving the cabal of villians from the last season, Ricardo Diaz emerges as a smart and worthwhile villian and a surprising twist, becoming the villian of the season. He comes off as the perfect ‘final villain’ that Team Arrow has to face at the street level. This year’s crossover I won’t get into as I talked about it in last month’s WAI_? Review. But the crossover feels less like a “crossover for all the shows” and more so a “the beginning of the end” for Arrow. But going back to the regularly scheduled archery, the seventh season manages to continue to find ways to bring Oliver Queen’s past to the present and change the status quo, despite 7 years of twists, turns, deaths and rebirths. The flash-forwards continue to aid in present day stories but also begin to hint at what lies after the story of Oliver Queen is over. By the end of the season, the end is definitely in sight for the series, as (apart from the flash forewards) no new plot threads are introduced and any remaining ones are finished. The season ends with the Monitor coming to collect Oliver, showing that it is indeed the end times.</p>

<p>This is it. The end of an era. The final season of Arrow. This is where all levels of groundedness and gritty street fighting are thrown out the window yet retained at the same time. Due to The Monitor’s powers, the season is spent going down memory lane as Oliver is brought to multiple Earth’s, reliving different variations of his past. Meanwhile, in the future, the next generation of heroes begin to get fleshed out and the purpose of these flash-forewards become clear when The Monitor brings them to the present to help with the impending Crisis (see last month’s WAI_?). I felt like this was pretty shoehorned but at this point I didn’t care because I really wanted Oliver to get the full treatment before his inevitable end. 7 of the 10 episodes in the season are spent preparing for Crisis. There’s no twist from Oliver’s past, no new villian, no ground breaking revelations (apart from the time traveling kids). It is simply the story of Oliver and his journey to becoming the savior of the multiverse, someone willing to put it all on the line knowing that he won’t make it to the end, a monumental step up from the original character seen in the beginning of the series. The flash-forewards finally pay off after Crisis where the potential spin-off with Oliver’s daughter Mia taking up the mantle of Green Arrow in the future. Finally in the series finale, where Oliver’s already been dead for three episodes, we see the outcomes of Crisis, and how Oliver sacrificed himself and rebuilt the new multiverse, changing aspects of the series as if they never happened (though the characters know of this change), bringing certain characters back from the dead and merging multiple earths together. It felt a lot like Tony Stark’s sacrifice at the end of Endgame. It was a very fitting send off for Oliver, as he was the helm of the Arrrowverse, he may as well save it and additionally recreate it in his image. His death and his sacrifice will forever change the multiverse with the ramifications definitely being felt in the <i>many</i> shows to come.</p>
