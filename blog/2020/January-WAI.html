    <p>This month on WAI_? that’s totally not 10+ days late, I listeneded to a bunch of podcasts. Started reading The Mighty Thor, A Flash Miniseries, and watched some shows. But the one big thing that I’m going to talk about this week is CW’s Crisis On Infinite Earths. Crisis (as I will refer to it henceforth) is the name of this year’s annual crossover between the shows that exist in the Arrowverse. Previous crossovers included Flash vs. Arrow, Heroes Join Forces, Invasion!, and Crisis on Earth X. But this year, Crisis On Infinite Earths, step the game up to a whole new level that I didn’t even know existed.</p>

<p>Crisis felt like a fever dream. Crisis to the Arrowverse to me felt like Endgame was to the MCU. It was the epitome of comic book crossover. It hit all the points that you would expect except for the fact that a show didn’t spin off directly from the crossover event like Legends of Tomorrow did. Some could argue that Green Arrow &amp; The Canaries could count as a spin-off but since it starts after the finale of Arrow I’m not counting it in my books. But nonetheless Crisis pleasantly took me by surprise and I enjoyed it very much.</p>

<p>Crisis was teased a whole god damn year earlier at the end of Elseworlds, which sucked at the time because that meant I had to wait a whole year to see what was going to happen next. The superheroes, in their respective shows would continue their own personal galavants, while the viewer probably forgot about the fact that Novu will be back for the next crossover event. Each show’s season finale roles around and suddenly there he is, pulling you out of the celebration that is the end of the season as each show’s hero(s) celebrates their win over that season’s bad guy. It felt really jarring whenever the show would non-chalantly cut to Novu standing in the crowd or at the doorway, reminding our heros of the upcoming Crisis. It definitely cut the season’s celebrations short as our heros are now reminded that even though it’s over.. it’s not over. I didn’t mind the jarring ending of each season but I definitely didn’t like how they were immediately worrying about the next threat just as the season ended.</p>

<p>When Crisis finally came, it felt something like a D&amp;D session. The Monitor (Novu), somehow aware of how the future should occur, would teleport around and assemble our heroes willy nilly, brought people back to life, gave people their powers back and was able to time travel and do as he pleases to move the plot forward. This was probably the biggest gripe I had while watching Crisis. It didn’t feel as organic as other crossover events but I don’t necessarily think it’s a bad thing. It definitely had an authentic comic book feel to it.</p>

<p>But then came the cameos, which I think was where all the budget for the crossover event went, because there was a lot of big names that cameo’d throughout the five episodes. Most notable ones were Ezra Miller’s DCEU Flash, which was a very pleasant surprise and something fans (as well as myself) wanted to see since the conception of both versions of the Flash. Johnn Wesley Shipp, who plays multiple characters in the show, returned as his role of 1990’s Barry Allen, making that show canon in the universe. Additionally, Smalleville’s Clark Kent was also present, as well as other DC shows that were never mentioned to be canon but now are.</p>

<p>It was apparent since Elseworlds that Oliver Queen as Arrow would be the main focus of Crisis, as it was teased since Crisis was announced, as well as played the major plot point for Arrow’s final season. Novu prophesized the Green Arrow’s death as he saved the universe. Seeing as it was announced that it was going to be Arrow’s final season, it was expected that Arrow would go out in a blaze of glory as he fought to save the universe. Did those expectations get met? Yes and no. DCTV’s crossover events are infamous for their parking lot fight scenes as our assembled heros fight countless unnamed CGI goonies and call it the Act III conflict and Crisis is no different. The first thing is that Arrow doesn’t even die on this home earth. He dies saving the the citizens of Earth-38, Supergirl’s earth. The second thing is he dies fighting a bunch of (you guessed it) unnamed CGI goonies. And the final nail on the coffin is it cuts away just as the fighting starts rolling and he gets teleported to the ship all battered and bruised and dies shortly thereafter. In my opinion that’s pretty anticlimactic for the titular character who launched the franchise to go. But Oliver Queen’s story isn’t over yet. This is a comic book universe after all, there is always an afterlife, and unsurprisingly, this isn’t the first time Oliver Queen has died. Even though his death is surprisingly the first episode in the crossover, he is still around in the subsequent episodes as some of the heros travel to the afterlife to try and bring back his soul to his body. This is where he gets revived as the Spectre. A powerful being that is meant to stop the protagonist of the whole event. This got my excited because now I get to see Oliver Queen in his final epic confrontational battle before he finally <i>actually<i> dies. But those expectations fall flat a second time. I was hoping for an epic fight sequence that Arrow is best at, mixed with extra magical powers that Spectre now has, but all I got 2-minute “fight” scene with okay CGI as the hero and villian embrace each other and stare into each others eyes in a mix between the final battle between Harry Potter and Voldemort with the purple swirlys at the end of Guardians of the Galaxy where they use the Power Stone. The “fight” ends in an explosion and Spectre’s second (this time real) death. Storywise the implications of this are far reaching as it reboots the universe and changes history and all that kind of comic booky stuff. But the fight itself? 5/10.</i></i></p>

<p>Finally, the rebooted universe is a fun treat. Flash, Supergirl, and Batwoman are now all on the same earth. Historys have been rewritten and it gives the writers a tool to fix any problems they may have written themselves into in previous seasons. I’m excited to see wehre it goes and welcome the new Universe with open arms. It’ll be interesting to see what the new world without Oliver Queen will be.</p>
